  abstract = {Scale-infested cycad leaves were sampled on the island of Guam in a wide range of habitats in 2017 and 2018 to determine the extent of parasitoid control of the scale. The sampling unit was a leaflet selected from five trees per habitat during each sampling date. The number of scales were counted with a hand lens and parasitoids were reared in a growth chamber at 60\% relative humidity. Infested leaflets were transferred to new rearing vessels after 48 hour intervals and returned to the growth chamber. Insects were rinsed with 70\% EtOH and parasitoids were counted with the aid of a microscope. The abaxial leaflet surfaces harbored greater numbers of scale than the adaxial surfaces. In a Northern Guam site where parasitoids were first fortuitously discovered in 2013, only 20\% of the samples yielded parasitoids. For each geographic site, the presence of parasitoids on one sampling date did not always lead to evidence of parasitoids at a later sampling date. The number of parasitized scales was minimal despite the widespread geographic occurrence of the parasitoids. Several native and exotic Cycas cycad species were historically heavily used in the commercial and residential landscapes of Guam, and the recent invasion of the cycad Aulacaspis scale (CAS) Aulacaspis yasumatsui Takagi has devastated these cycad populations. These results provide the first evidence that scale parasitoids are established throughout most of the island, but they are not effectively controlling the scale infestations. This case study is an example of how the horticulture profession can aid in responding to an ecological disaster.},

  abstract = {The literature covering the biology, invasion chronology, host plant responses, and control efforts of the armored scale Aulacaspis yasumatsui Takagi (Hempitera: Diaspididae) is reviewed. The small size of this cycad pest and complex surface morphology of the host cycad organs combine to make visual detection of every cryptic infestation difficult or impossible to achieve. The international movement of Cycas revoluta Thunb. nursery plants and the presence of C. revoluta nursery industries in so many countries have enabled this pest to wreak havoc on the international cycad horticulture trade over the last 25 years. The short pre-oviposition period and considerable female fecundity lead to rapid population expansion on the plants initially infested in newly invaded regions. A depletion of non-structural carbohydrates accompanies long-term infestations and precedes plant death. Enemy escape within the invasive range allows the scale population growth to remain unchecked until anthropogenic efforts establish non-native biological control.},

  abstract = {Guam's ecosystems are under attack by invasive species. Many people know about extinction of Guam's birds by the brown tree snake which invaded the island shortly after WWII. But the contemporary ecological disaster which is currently happening in Guam's forests is not well known. In 2002 a US Forest Service survey found the endemic cycad, Cycas micronesica, to be the most abundant tree in Guam's forests and coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, to be the second most abundant tree. Both species are now under severe attack by invasive insect species. About 90\% of C. micronesica trees have been killed by Asian cycad scale, Aulacaspis yasumatsui, first detected in 2003. The predatory beetle, Rhyzobius lophanthae, was introduced and it is protecting mature plants but no seedlings are surviving. Coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, was first detected in 2007 and an uncontrolled outbreak of this pest is currently killing coconut palms throughout the island. Following a failed eradication attempt, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) and Metarhizium majus fungus were introduced as biocontrol agents. OrNV unexpectedly failed as a biocontrol agent for CRB on Guam. Previously, this pathogen produced excellent results when released on Pacific Islands infested with CRB. Subsequent laboratory bioassays and genetic analysis showed that the CRB which invaded Guam belong to an OrNV resistant biotype named CRB-G which is involved in all recent invasions of CRB in the Pacific. The fungus, M. majus rapidly established and spread to CRB breeding sites throughout the island, with infection rates measured between 10\% and 38\%. But this level of suppression was not enough to prevent the current outbreak which was triggered by abundant breeding sites left in the wake of Typhoon Dolphin which passed over Guam in May 2015. Attempts to overcome these IPM failures will be discussed.},
